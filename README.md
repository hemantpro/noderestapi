# Overview

This script is to build a HTTP web server API in nodejs that interacts with the GitHub API and responds to requests on /<USER> with a list of the userâ€™s publicly available Gists.

http://localhost:8080/octocat

# Prerequisites

- Docker is installed and running locally
- Latest Node.js installed

### Install Docker
Docker Engine / Docker Desktop

# Script high-level Info

RestApi has been developed using following nodejs modules

- `express` and `axios` 

And for test automation, following nodejs modules have been used:

- `supertest` and `jest`


# Getting Started
## Get the sample application
Clone the sample application to use with this Readme. Open a terminal, change directory to a directory that you have used to clone the code.

## Build HTTP WebServer
Install Node Dependenices based on package.json

` npm install`

### Running the app

 ``` node index.js ```
- Open the browser and enter http://localhost:8080/[username] e.g. http://localhost:8080/octocat

### Testing the app
 ```node test```

## Dockerize the WebServer API
- Confirm you are in the root of project directory
- Create an docker image based on the Dockerfile

 `Docker build -t "hg/gist" .`
- Create and Start the container based on the image

 `Docker run -d --name "hg_gist_server" -p 8080:8080 hg/gist`
### Running the app
- Open the browser and enter http://localhost:8080/[username] e.g. http://localhost:8080/octocat

### Troubleshooting
>- Docker image ls ->> [to check if image is available]
>- Docker container ps [to check if container is running]
